        <p>The <strong>Scrum of Scrums</strong> meeting is an important technique in scaling Scrum to large project teams. These meetings allow clusters of teams to discuss their work, focusing especially on areas of overlap and integration. Imagine a perfectly balanced project comprising seven teams each with seven team members. Each of the seven teams would conduct (simultaneously or sequentially) its own daily scrum meeting. Each team would then designate one person to also attend a <strong>Scrum of Scrums</strong> meeting. The decision of who to send should belong to the team. Usually the person chosen should be a technical contributor on the team—a programmer, tester, database administrator, designer, and so on—rather than a product owner or ScrumMaster.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Scrum of Scrums</strong> meetings can be scaled up in a recursive manner. Imagine there are seven <strong>Scrum of Scrums</strong> meetings occurring in your organization. Each contains a representative from each of seven teams (as in the previous example). The work of the seven <strong>Scrum of Scrums</strong> meetings can be coordinated through an even higher level meeting: what might be called a scrum of <strong>Scrum of Scrums</strong>. (It isn't usually called this, though, because things start to sound a bit silly at some point. <strong>Scrum of Scrums</strong> often suffices even for these higher levels of meeting.)</p>
        <p> A good agenda for the <strong>Scrum of Scrums</strong> meetings is similar to the standard agenda for the daily scrum. In that meeting each team member is asked:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What did you do yesterday?</li>
            <li>What will you do today</li>
            <li>What obstacles are in your way or slowing you down?</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Because the <strong>Scrum of Scrums</strong> meetings may not be daily and because one person is there representing his or her entire team, these three questions need to be rephrased a bit. I also find it beneficial to add a fourth question:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What has your team done since we last met?</li>
            <li>What will your team do before we meet again?</li>
            <li>Is anything slowing your team down or getting in their way?</li>
            <li>Are you about to put something in another team’s way?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This last question can be extremely helpful when coordinating the work of multiple teams. Common answers are things like, “We’re about to do a major check-in of the payroll processing code. We had to restructure the version control repository to do that, which made us rewrite a big part of the build script. But we’ve thoroughly tested everything and don’t expect this check-in to break anything.” Well, we all know how that story ends. Having advance notice of potential impediments like this can be very helpful. The <strong>Scrum of Scrums</strong> meeting starts with each participant answering these four questions. Like the daily scrum, this part of the meeting is meant to be fast-paced and fairly short. One technique I’ve found helpful in achieving this is adopting a rule that no names can be used. There are two reasons for this. First, leaving out names keeps the discussion at the appropriate level of detail. While attending the meeting, I want to hear about each team, not about each person on each team. Second, too many people equate importance with how long they talk during a meeting. Removing the ability to describe the activities and plans of each person on a team goes a long way to keeping this part of the meeting short. During this part of the meeting problems can and should be raised, but solutions should not be discussed and considered until after everyone has had a chance to answer these four questions.</p>
        <p>One last difference between the daily scrum and the <strong>Scrum of Scrums</strong> meetings is that while most <strong>Scrum of Scrums</strong> meetings maintain a backlog of issues and problems to address, very few conduct formal iteration planning and iteration reviews analogous to what the individual teams are doing. Participants in the <strong>Scrum of Scrums</strong> meetings are first and foremost individual contributors on their teams. The higher-level <strong>Scrum of Scrums</strong> is a more transient group; each iteration has the potential to bring a new set of attendees. The iteration planning and commitments that drive a project forward belong, for the most part, at the individual team level. Some <strong>Scrum of Scrums</strong> may conduct iteration planning meetings, but if they do, these are usually much less formal than what the individual teams do and consist of general goals for an iteration such as “we’ll address this issue, that issue, and resolve that other problem.”</p>
